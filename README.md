### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my mess of a Github-Profile! ðŸ˜€
I use Github mainly to try out things. I do try to contribute to larger open-source efforts, if there is the chance.
I tagged most repositiories so that you can get an in intial overview of that repo.

You can group those repositories into several categories
- Trying out new frontend frameworks:
  - I want to implement a similar use case when fiddling with a new framework: That used to be a concert tracker, but I switched over to a soccer table some time ago.
  - With that I want to see:
    - How does it feel working with that framework
    - How do I incorporate 3rd party libs (like Drag and Drop)
    - How do go about external data. Though I resort to local storage most of the time, due to ease of deployment
    - How easy is it to deploy this.
- Preparing episodes for [Papperlapapp](https://www.youtube.com/c/papperlapapp-dev) and [@Autoweird.fm](https://autoweird.fm)
- Providing little snippets to be discussed within the team
- Contributing to open-source libs, like Zustand or Cosmos DB

Please feel free, to browse around. And just ping me, if you have suggestion or question.
